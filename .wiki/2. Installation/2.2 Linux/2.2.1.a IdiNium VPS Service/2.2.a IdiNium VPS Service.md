## FAQ
### Q: How this works?
> A: I will create a new VPS from Hetzner, you'll only need to provide me your SSH Public Key so it will be added to your VPS and you can connect to it after you've sent the correct amount of pure and I've successfully accepted it. You will have FULL CONTROL over your own VPS.

### Q: Will you (IdiNium) have access to my VPS?
> A: No, because I will only add your SSH Public Key, which means I can't connect to your VPS because I don't have a Private Key that associated with your Public Key, so it's 100% your responsibility.

### Q: Is there any other services available?
> A: Yes:
> - Backup: automatic copies of your server disks (7 slots for backups) - adds 20%/month
> - Snapshots: instant copies of your disks - add 1 ref/GB/month
> - Floating IPs - adds 40 ref/month
> - Add more Volumes (up to 10 TB) - adds 1.5 ref/GB/month
> - Rescale (change your current service) - add to the respective amount of keys/refs.

### Q: Any other services other than cloud VPS?
> A: Yes, visit https://www.hetzner.de/?country=ot and I'll decide the price in pure.

### Q: What if I want to register Hetzner myself?
> A: Use this [link](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=68H4N0lNcT1W) and you will get free €20 for a month!
